# Cryptography
# using the fennet encryption on crypto library
# implement a basic logic of locating the encryption/decryption key by hashing both the user's private key and encrypted secret key.

#if the encrypted message has been edited, the file of the encryption/decryption key will not be found directly on the shell app
#creating a form of integrity without hashing the encrypted text and comparing it to the encryption itself
